# ServiceLink Database Setup

This directory contains the database schema and sample data for the ServiceLink University Ticketing System.

## Files

- **`schema.sql`** - Complete database schema with tables, relationships, and sample data
- **`sample_data.sql`** - Additional sample data (optional, for testing)

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Complete Setup (Recommended)
Run the main schema file which includes everything:
```sql
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
```

### Option 2: Schema Only + Sample Data Later
If you want to set up the schema first and add sample data later:
```sql
-- First, create the basic schema (you'll need to modify schema.sql to exclude sample data)
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql

-- Then add sample data
mysql -u root -p servicelink_db < sample_data.sql
```
